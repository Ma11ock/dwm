Here is my dwm build optimzed for Emacs.

It is a [[https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwm][fork of Luke Smith's dwm config]] so all of his patches (up to the version that was forked) and other details also apply, except for the keybindings.

* Installation for newbs
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make && sudo make install && make clean
#+END_SRC

This fork also puts a dwm.desktop file in 
#+BEGIN_SRC 
/usr/share/xsessions/ 
#+END_SRC
so a desktop manager such as lightdm will be able to boot into dwm.

* Remember to install [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/][:libxft-bgra]]
...unless you want dwm to crash every time it encounters an emoji.
