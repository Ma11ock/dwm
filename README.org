Here is my dwm build optimzed for Emacs.

It is a [[https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwm][fork of Luke Smith's dwm config]] so all of his patches (up to the version that was forked) and other details also apply, except for the keybindings.


* Remember to install [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/][`libxft-bgra`]]
...unless you want dwm to crash every time it encounters an emoji.
